    <div class="text">Background Evidence: Avril Lavigne gained fame at only 18-years-old after the realease of her first album, "Let Go", in 2002. Not being able to handle the paparazzi due to her immense fame at this time, she decided on hiring a look alkike to walk around LA and pose for the paparazzi. Her name is Melissa Vandella.</div></div>


<h2>Avril who?</h2>
<div class="p2"><p>Tragically, Lavigne's grandfather, who was her best friend and biggest supporter, had died and it took a big toll on her. She was obviously distraught, crying on stage and during interviews. Sources say she killed her self in 2003, but because she was THE "punk princess" and it was the peak of her career, they used her look alike to take over her life. Heard in videos, "Avril's" vocals have a different style then when she first started her career. Also, many of the birthmarks Avril had before are mysteriously gone. Her writing has changed aswell!</p>
